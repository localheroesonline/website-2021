title: 'Troost Barley Wine'
exclude: false
description: 'Award winning Barleywine that we make with nothing but organic barley. Every year this is the beer that takes us the longest to brew but it is definitely worth it. This is a powerful beer that gives you maltiness in the nose and hint of caramel. The flavour is surprisingly fruity with roasted nuts in the aftertaste.

This beer won a Bronze medal at the Brussels Beer Challenge 2020.'

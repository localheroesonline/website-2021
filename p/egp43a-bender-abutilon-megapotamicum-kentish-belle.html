title: 'Abutilon megapotamicum &#039;Kentish Belle&#039;'
exclude: false
description: 'This is a graceful, willowy shrub with fine arching branches and flowers that hang like pendants along the length of the stems. The leaves are small compared to the larger hybrid Abutilons so the flowers are not obstructed. The soft warm yellow petals and the red calyces go very well together and give the plant a flamboyant but not overly brash look.

It is evergreen where temperatures stay above freezing but is likely to lose its leaves when the weather gets cold. It is not reliably hardy so is best grown in a pot and given winter protection where there is a risk of frost. In a container it may need to be supported by discretely arranged twigs if it is to give any height to the middle of a planting.

As the branches extend the weight of the flowers pulls them down.'

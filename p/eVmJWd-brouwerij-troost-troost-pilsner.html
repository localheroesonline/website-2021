title: 'Troost Pilsner'
exclude: false
description: 'Pilsner
Pilsner brewed with organic barley malt and hops. Due to the cold fermentation, pilsner is relatively difficult for small breweries to make. But if it succeeds, it is also much better than from the large factory, because we do not filter and do not use rice or corn to dilute the beer. Our aroma hops make this a fresh beer with a fine finish and a nice bitter.

Available on tap and in cans (organic).

Alcohol percentage: 4.8%'

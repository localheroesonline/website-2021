exclude: false
description: 'I.P.A.
The myth has it that this originally English beer was made extra heavy and hoppy for long sea voyages. The Americans should have taken it up on arrival, but they didn’t. As a result, we now have this delicious bitter beer with a lot of citrus, full caramel and a lemony aftertaste.

Available on tap and in cans (organic).

Alcohol percentage: 6.5% alcohol'

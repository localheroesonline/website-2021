Spaghetti is long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta, created from organic semola di Grano duro (100%), free range eggs, and water.

This pasta has been bronze drawn from our pasta machine in order to get as much sauce as possible and goes well with both of our sauces.

We recommend to try it with our “Crema di asparagi alla romana”

exclude: false
description: 'Asparagus are cooked in 2 ways. The lower part is slowly caramelized with some onions and glazed with Asparagus broth. Once they are cooked we bland it together with some Pecorino romano DOP to create a perfect cream. The top of the asparagus is sauté in butter for the extra bite. On the side we cooked some guanciale (cured cheek of the pig)until crispy and then added to the sauce. We have one of the best guanciale you could find in Italy. The Nero Siciliano it’s a very particular breed (black pig), which has a very deep flavor because the animal has eaten the entire life only organic food found at the Monti Nebrodi. Try it out with our Paccheri or Spaghetti. van La Spaghettata'

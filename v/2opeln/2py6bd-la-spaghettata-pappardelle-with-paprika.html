title: 'Pappardelle with paprika van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'This beautiful pasta comes from Tuscany. It is 2-3 times larger then the tagliatelle and thanks to its shape can take more sauce on the top of its dough. This pappardelle is cut by hand with the use of a knife, and for this menu we are adding some paprika to the dough (made of flour 00 and egg yolks only). This will bring deepness and sweet taste to your dish and will create a unique taste. We recommend trying it with our &#039;&#039;Sugo alla Trinita.&#039;&#039; Allergen: Gluten, eggs 1 portion = 120g van La Spaghettata'

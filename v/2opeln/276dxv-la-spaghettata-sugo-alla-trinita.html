title: 'Sugo alla trinita van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'This tomato sauce is one of the creations which I love the most because of the simplicity of its ingredients yet very complexed to perfectionalize and to balance all flavours. The first time i cooked this recipe was at a weekend away with friends. They were blown away by how good it was. It is now time to share it with the world... Made from 3 types of fresh tomatoes (the trinity): cherry tomato, san marzano and roma tomatoes. The sauce has a very rich and comforting taste, plus who does not love tomatoes? We create it based on our soffrito (onion, carrot, celery) and some basil stem. Once nicely roasted, we add the tomatoes all together and we let them cook for around 11 hours. We finish with more basil and our secret ingredient... &quot;butter&quot; like my nonna used to say; life is better with butter - and damn she was right! Enjoy this holy sauce with our orecchiette, casarecce or pappardelle with paprika for an amazing experience! I can assure you it is not a boring tomato sauce from the grocery store... Allergen: celery, dairy 1 Jar = 2/3 portions van La Spaghettata'

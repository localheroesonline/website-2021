title: 'Casarecce van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'Casarecce are short twists of pasta originating from Sicily which look to be rolled up on themselves by forming a little S shape on the side. Whoever invented this shape had only one goal, get the sauce into the pasta - which we won&#039;t complain! This pasta is our latest addition to our catalogue and is bronze extruded with our machine. It is very easy to eat, and blends well with all types of sauces, which makes it addictive. 

We use organic durum wheat semola from Italy, free range eggs and water.

Allergen: Gluten, eggs

1 portion = 120g van La Spaghettata'

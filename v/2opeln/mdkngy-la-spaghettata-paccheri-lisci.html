description: 'Paccheri (also called schiaffoni) is a traditional Neapolitan pasta which looks like giant macaroni. In Italian, the word for slap is ‘schiaffo’. Whereas in Neapolitan dialect, it’s ‘una pacca’. Many attribute the name/s to the ‘slapping’ noise made when pouring sauce onto the pasta!

These short wide pasta tubes are usually served with rich heavier sauces or seafood.Try it with our own original twist with the sauce : Crema di Asparagi alla romana.

This pasta is freshly bronze extruded by our machine and we use organic durum wheat semola from Italy, free range eggs and water.

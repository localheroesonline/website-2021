title: 'Raviolo with black ink squid filled with crab meat, mascarpone and green lemon zest van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'Our June&#039;s menu raviolo are round shape pasta filled with crab meat, mascarpone and green lemon zest. These beautiful filled pasta are so elegant with the combination of two colors on the pasta sheet. The black color lines come from the black ink squid, which adds an extra flavor and texture to the crab meat. The mascarpone is melting inside the pasta dough, while the green lemon zest brings that pop of freshness we all want. To keep it light, and to only focus on this delicious sense, we recommend pairing the raviolo with our homemade butter and chive. Beautiful inside and out, you need to try it! Allergen: Gluten, eggs, dairy, fish 1 portion = 10 pieces van La Spaghettata'

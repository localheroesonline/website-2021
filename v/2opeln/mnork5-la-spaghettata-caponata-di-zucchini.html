title: 'Caponata di Zucchini van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'This very particular version of caponata is made of zucchini instead of the usual eggplants. This recipe was inspired by my mother who used to cook this dish during my youth and I tweaked it a bit according to my culinary taste.
We have infused the olive oil in basil stem and garlic for deepness, then caramelized the onions for sweet and comfort.
We have added the zucchini and let them slowly cook until soft. Finally we have added some pine nuts for some nutty flavor.
This is the perfect Italian vegan recipe which will give you this Sunday vibe comfort. A must try with our Tagliatelle gourmet or Paccheri Lisci.

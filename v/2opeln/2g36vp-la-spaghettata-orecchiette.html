title: 'Orecchiette van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'The orecchiette are a handmade type of pasta coming from Puglia, with a shape of an ear, hence why the name. Traditionally, this pasta shape is most popular with vegetable sauce. You should try it with our &quot;Caponata di melanzane&quot; or &quot;Sugo alla trinita&quot;, as thanks to the shape of this pasta, the sauce will fill each orecchiette and give each bite an incredible pleasure. It is made of typical Italian flour &quot;Semola di grano duro rimacinata&quot;; which is imported from Italy, as well as some water is used to create it.

This is 100% VEGAN.

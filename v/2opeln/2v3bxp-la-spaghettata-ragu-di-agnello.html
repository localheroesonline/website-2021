title: 'Ragu di Agnello van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'This lamb ragù recipe comes from France and as I spent most of my life in the South of France, I wanted to bring some learnings from one of the best countries for its gastronomy. I thus adapted this lamb ragù with an Italian touch. A piece of lamb shoulder (nl) is cut into nice cubes and cooked in a soffrito (onion, celery and carrot) with garlic and fresh origano. Once everything is roasted, we deglaze the meat with an amazing wine from Tuscany - il seggio 2018 - bolgheri - poggio al tesoro, a mix of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and petit verdot. The meat will slowly cook for over 4 hours to be as smooth as butter. to give some extra boost we added pecorino romano d.o.p and some mint for freshness. For a special meal, try it out with our pappardelle with paprika or with our casarecce. Honestly one of my favorite ragù. Allergen: contains: celery, dairy Contains lamb meat 1 Jar = 2/3 portions van La Spaghettata'

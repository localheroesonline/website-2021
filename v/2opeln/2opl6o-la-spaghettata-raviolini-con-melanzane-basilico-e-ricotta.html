title: 'Raviolini con melanzane, basilico e ricotta van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'Raviolini means “small ravioli” and they originated from Sardinia. Size is 3cm by 3cm and they are filled with roasted eggplant, basil and fresh artisanal ricotta. Expect deepness from the mix of roasted eggplant, freshness from the basil and smoothness from the ricotta. This recipe was inspired by my grandmother who is from Sardinia and used to make this tiny ravioli for me when I was only 5 years old… This is the perfect dish to share with friends, family and even with your kid! Make sure to try it with our fresh homemade butter &amp; dry tomatoes… van La Spaghettata'

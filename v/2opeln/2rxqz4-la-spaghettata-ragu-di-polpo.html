title: 'Ragù di polpo van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'This sauce comes directly from my father, very few ingredients, but the whole difficulty of it is to cook the octopus in the right way to make it tender as butter. Prepared with olive oil and garlic, the octopus needs to be cooked twice for 2hours and boiled into the Napolitan tomatoes to bring amazing flavor. At the last 20min we are adding the olive taggiasche. After that, the sauce needs to rest for about 24hours. You can thus imagine how flavored the ragù will become, strong yet so tender. One of Constance&#039;s favorite sauces! All kinds of pasta go well with this sauce, however I recommend you try with our “conchiglione with black ink squid” or “Spaghetti alla chitarra”. van La Spaghettata'

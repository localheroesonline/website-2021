title: 'Agnolotto di Primavera van La Spaghettata'
exclude: false
description: 'Agnolotto stands for a different type of ravioli, which uses less dough for closing so that the feeling is even more pronounced for an explosion of flavour.

This special agnolotto contains an amazing mix of sweet tastes coming from peas and yellow onions, floral and earthy taste from saffron imported from Abruzzo.

We have also added some parmesan to get that extra salty and deep flavour.

Must try with butter and sage sauce. Created from organic flour 00 and organic durum wheat flour and free range eggs.

exclude: false
description: 'The bestseller of all times...

We introduced this recipe back then when we were cooking from home and it has been one of the greatest successes for la spaghettata. Should we call it our DNA sauce? Then make sure to try it.

Originated from sicily, this recipe can be interpreted in multiple ways. Each city in Sicily has its own variation. I am offering at la spaghettata my own excellent interpretation, which links different flavors from fried eggplants, fresh tomatoes, pine nuts and fresh chopped basil. Back then this sauce was mainly used as a side dish, however today it can be eaten as a main dish on top of bread or pasta.

We recommend to eat it with the fresh orecchiette or casarecce for a great culinary experience.

exclude: false
description: 'Commonly called ‘shells’ or ‘seashells’ because of their shape, conchiglie is a type of pasta that does actually look like conch shells. In fact, the word ‘conchiglia’ in Italian means seashell. Conchiglie have a ridged exterior and smooth interior which means that the inside fills up when stirred in the sauce, whilst the ridges enable the sauce to adhere to the outside as well. So every mouthful is totally delicious! This one is created with durum wheat flour (organic), free range eggs and black ink squid. Try them out with our Ragù di polpo… It’s just incredible! van La Spaghettata'

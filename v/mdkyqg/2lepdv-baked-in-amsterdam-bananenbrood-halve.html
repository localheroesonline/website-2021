exclude: false
description: 'Made with 50% bananas, our banana bread is the cornerstone of our little baking fiefdom (we’re not quite big enough to be an empire just yet), and is absolutely delicious. The popularity of our best-selling item means that we go through a tonne of bananas a month!

Our secret is to keep it simple – we’re making you banana bread the traditional and simple way. Enjoy the bread toasted, with a healthy slathering of warm salted butter. van Baked in Amsterdam'
